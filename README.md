# Crossplane Provider for Zscaler Private Access (ZPA)

`crossplane-provider-zpa` is a [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) provider that
is built using [Upjet](https://github.com/upbound/upjet) code
generation tools and exposes XRM-conformant managed resources for the
ZPA API.

## Getting Started

Install the provider by using the following command after changing the image tag
to the [latest release](https://marketplace.crossplane.io/providers/zscaler/crossplane-provider-zpa):
```
up ctp provider install zscaler/crossplane-provider-zpa:v0.1.0
```

Alternatively, you can use declarative installation:
```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: crossplane-provider-zpa
spec:
  package: zscaler/crossplane-provider-zpa:v0.1.0
EOF
```

Notice that in this example Provider resource is referencing ControllerConfig with debug enabled.

You can see the API reference [here](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/zscaler/crossplane-provider-zpa).
